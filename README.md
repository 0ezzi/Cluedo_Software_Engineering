# Cluedo – Software Engineering Diagrams

This repository contains a set of Software Engineering diagrams created as part of a university assignment.  
The diagrams model the theoretical design of a digital version of the board game **Clue (Cluedo)**.

## Included Diagram Types
- **Use Case Diagrams** – Describe the main interactions between players and the system, outlining functional requirements.  
- **Class Diagrams** – Represent the structural design of core game entities such as characters, rooms, weapons, and game logic components.  
- **Sequence Diagrams** – Show key interaction flows within the system, e.g., making a suggestion, processing turns, or verifying accusations.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to model and document the essential logic and structure of a Clue-inspired game system. These diagrams provide a foundation for understanding requirements, planning architecture, and supporting potential future implementation.

## Structure
- `usecase/` – Use case diagrams  
- `class/` – Class diagrams  
- `sequence/` – Sequence diagrams  
- `README.md` – Overview of the project

## Project Management
Our workflow and progress were tracked using a Trello board:
